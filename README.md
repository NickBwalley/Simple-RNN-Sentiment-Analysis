# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Simple RNN

This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis** model using a **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to classify IMDB movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. The model is designed to analyze user-submitted reviews and predict their sentiment with impressive accuracy.

The application is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing a clean and interactive interface where users can submit reviews and instantly receive a sentiment prediction. The underlying model has been trained on the widely recognized **IMDB Movie Review** dataset, ensuring its performance is well-suited for movie review sentiment analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickBwalley/Simple-RNN-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Deep-Learning-For-NLP/Simple-RNN
```

### 2. Create a New Conda Environment

To maintain a clean environment for dependencies, it's recommended to create a new Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n imdb_sentiment_env python=3.11.11
conda activate imdb_sentiment_env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

All required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

Once everything is set up, you can launch the Streamlit application with this command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
